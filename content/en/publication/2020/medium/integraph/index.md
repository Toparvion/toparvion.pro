abstract: |
  Spring Integration framework is able to [represent](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/reference/html/system-management.html#integration-graph) the current state of all [EIP](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) components and their relations in the form of a JSON graph. It seems useful for learning and debugging but unfortunately none of the googleable tools (which are just [1st](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo/tree/angular-1.x/samples/spring-flo-si) and [2nd](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/architecture/2018/01/27/Visualizing-your-Spring-Integration-components-and-flows.html)) gives enough flexibility for visualization and analysis of such a graph. In this article Iâ€™ll show you how to address this problem by importing the graph into the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/neo4j-graph-database/) graph database where such abilities are the first class citizens.
