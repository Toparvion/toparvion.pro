A passionate developer, research enthusiast, open source fan, happy father, amateur athlete – that's what describes me, your host on this another personal web page.

Here I&nbsp;share my [experience](/en/background/#experience) in&nbsp;various professional fields that I discover in my&nbsp;job and hobby. For instance, there are several [helpful tools](/en/#projects) that I&nbsp;created for&nbsp;simplifying day-to-day work. There’re also a&nbsp;few [explanatory articles](/en/#posts) about different aspects of enterprise development in Java&trade;.

As a&nbsp;citizen of&nbsp;West Siberia, I use [Russian](/ru) as my primary language so&nbsp;please be&nbsp;patient to my&nbsp;deficient English. Whichever language you speak, I’m&nbsp;pleased to&nbsp;meet you here! :slightly_smiling_face:
