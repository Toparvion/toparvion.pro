Since his school days Vladimir was enthusiastic about programming and from then on has managed to code everything: from Soviet programmable calculators to modern SCADA systems in production. For the last several years he has been involved in backend development of Internet banking and other follow-up services at CFT (Center of Financial Technologies), where he actively stands for microservices and other popular things. Constantly bothers with ideas about optimization of difficult development/server software testing tasks, nurtures solutions for them while jogging or swimming and then puts them into life, experimenting shamelessly on his colleagues.
